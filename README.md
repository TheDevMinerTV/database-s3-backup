# Database Backup to S3 with Docker

This application automates the process of backing up PostgreSQL and MySQL databases and uploading them to an S3-compatible storage service, utilizing Docker for easy deployment and scheduling.

## Features

- Easy deployment with Docker and Docker Compose.
- Support for multiple PostgreSQL and MySQL databases.
- Customizable backup intervals.
- Direct upload of backups to an S3-compatible storage bucket.
- Environment variable and command-line configuration for flexibility.
- Secure handling of database and S3 credentials.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.
- Access to PostgreSQL and/or MySQL databases.
- Access to an S3-compatible storage service.

## Configuration

Before running the application, you need to configure it either by setting environment variables in a `.env` file or by using command-line flags in the `docker-compose.yml`.

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project directory with the following variables:

- `URLS`: Comma-separated list of database URLs to backup. Format for PostgreSQL: `postgres://<user>:<password>@<host>[:<port>]/<dbname>` and for MySQL: `mysql://<user>:<password>@<host>[:<port>]/<dbname>`
- `S3_ENDPOINT`: The endpoint URL of your S3-compatible storage service.
- `S3_BUCKET`: The name of the bucket where backups will be stored.
- `S3_ACCESS_KEY`: Your S3 access key.
- `S3_SECRET_KEY`: Your S3 secret key.
- `INTERVAL`: How often to run the backup (e.g., `24h` for daily backups).

### Docker Compose

Alternatively, you can specify the configuration directly in the `docker-compose.yml` file under the `environment` section of your service:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    build: .
    environment:
      URLS: "postgres://user:password@host:port/dbname,mysql://user:password@host:port/dbname"
      S3_ENDPOINT: "your_s3_endpoint"
      S3_BUCKET: "your_s3_bucket"
      S3_ACCESS_KEY: "your_s3_access_key"
      S3_SECRET_KEY: "your_s3_secret_key"
      INTERVAL: "24h"
```

## Running the Application with Docker

There is an image available on `ghcr.io/thedevminertv/database-s3-backup` that you can use.

Alternatively, you can build the image yourself:

1. Build the Docker image:

   ```sh
   docker compose build
   ```

2. Start the application:

   ```sh
   docker compose up -d
   ```

This will start the application in the background. It will automatically perform backups for both PostgreSQL and MySQL databases based on the configured interval and upload them to the specified S3 bucket.

## Monitoring and Logs

To monitor the application's activity and view logs:

```sh
docker compose logs -f
```

This command will follow the log output of the container. Press `Ctrl+C` to exit log following.

## Updating Configuration

If you need to update the configuration, modify the `.env` file or the `docker-compose.yml` as necessary and restart the service:

```sh
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```
